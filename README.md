# ELEC-E8125 - Reinforcement Learning D - Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises from the course **ELEC-E8125 - Reinforcement Learning D** at **Aalto University**. Each exercise focuses on various aspects of reinforcement learning, including policy iteration, value iteration, function approximation, and more.

The solutions are provided in various formats, including code and documentation, and aim to demonstrate the practical application of theoretical concepts discussed during the course.
